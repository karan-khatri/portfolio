            Hi there! I'm Karan Kumar Khatri, an ambitious MERN stack developer hailing from
            Karachi, Pakistan. With 2+ years of experience, I've honed my skills in crafting
            end-to-end web apps with a strong focus on intuitive user interfaces. <br /> <br /> My
            journey has led me to master technologies like React, Vue.js, Material UI, Ant Design,
            and more. I take pride in my ability to write efficient test cases, collaborate with
            remote teams, and deliver top-notch solutions. <br /> <br /> Currently, I'm seeking an
            exciting role as a MERN stack developer in UAE, where I can fuel my passion for the
            latest tech and make a significant impact. Let's connect and explore how we can create
            something extraordinary together!
